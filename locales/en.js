                            <p>Here are some tips to increase your probability of selling your images:</p> \
                            <p class='dot'> Review the tags of your images. Be precise, tag not only what you can see on the image, also think of emotions, colours, places, adjectives and contexts.</p> \
                            <p class='dot'> Promote your best images: share them on social network. The more stars they get the better position they will have in the search results.</p> \
                            <p class='dot'> Participate in Requests with your best work and perspectives. Agencies need the images you take, but they want the best quality.</p> \
                            <p class='dot'> Take care of the light, angle and colours. Take a look at photography tutorials and learn to take professional quality pictures.  It is not easy but it is exciting.</p> \
                            <p class='dot'> Eliminate photos from your account that do not add quality to your gallery.</p> \
                            <p class='dot'> Raise your level in AGORA images and you will have more opportunities to sell your images.</p> \
                            <p>If after doing all of this you still do not sell anything, write to us to <span class='_underline'> hello@agoraimages.com</span> and we will take a look at your account.</p> \

                            <p>When a buyer pays for an image, the author of the image receives the money on Stripe and AGORA images allows the image to be downloaded in its original resolution and size without a watermark. At the time of purchase a digital ticket is issued for both the buyer and the seller. AGORA images does not have access to that money and does not charge any commission in the sale process.  Stripe will charge appropriate payment processing fees.</p> \
